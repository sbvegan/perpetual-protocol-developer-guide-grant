# Perpetual Protocol Developer Guide Grant

Developer Guide

## My Submission
You: I am a Computer Scientist with a couple years of software engineering experience, a year doing solutions engineering, and I'm looking to shift my focus to the world of web3. I have been a degen in the past, but I'm looking to now approach this space as a professional. I'm looking to learn, contribute, and grow as an Ethereum engineer. In this case, I'm planning on building on top of PerpV2 and launch a personal automated spot/futures funding arbitrage strategy. Also,  I am getting married at the end of March so until then, I won't have my full free time capacity to work on my web3 development stuff.

Project Goals : Teach other developers to programmatically interact with the Perpetual Protocol.
### Milestones:  

#### Milestone 1

Successfully programmatically pulled the mark price, index price, and funding rate from the mainnet contracts by Feb 4th.

#### Milestone 2

Break down the code in to a concise article that developers can use to implement the same functionality in their own code by Feb. 25th

### Project Description: 

Perpetual Protocol V2 developer docs are extremely lacking at the moment. I'd like to take a look at the smart contracts and create guides to teach developers to programmatically interact with the protocol. My personal goal is to develop trading strategies on Curie, so I'd also like to create a guide to get an assets mark price, index price, and the current funding rate.

### Funding Request

For each milestone, I am requesting $1000. An upfront funding of $500 would definitely spur the effort.
